# binge2Data
The data from BingeWorthy 2 so we don't have to work so hard to recreate parts of it that we want to keep. 

### Why this is public?

All this data was part of the public graph of Bingeworthy 2, there was a user interface to access all of it. I want to add the ability for people to re-use their ratings in the new version of Bingeworthy that's coming, so having this data available easily (without work for me, very important) is the right way to go.

### What's here

1. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/programs.json">programs.json</a> -- data for each program that we have ratings for. The title, the username of the person who added it to the database, whether it was approved, when it was created or modified.

2. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/ratings.json">ratings.json</a> -- a very large file containing the rating for each user and each program.

3. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/watchlist.json">watchlist.json</a> -- all the programs on the watchlists of all users. 

4. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data/users">users</a> -- a folder containing the ratings for each user individually. sort of like your opml list from a feed reader.
