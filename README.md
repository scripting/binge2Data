# binge2Data
The data from BingeWorthy 2 so we don't have to work so hard to recreate parts of it that we want to keep. 

##### What's here

1. programs.json -- data for each program that we have ratings for. The title, the username of the person who added it to the database, whether it was approved, when it was created or modified.

2. ratings.json -- a very large file containing the rating for each user and each program.

3. watchlist.json -- all the programs on the watchlists of users. 

4. users -- a folder containing the ratings for each user individually. sort of like your opml list from a feed reader.
